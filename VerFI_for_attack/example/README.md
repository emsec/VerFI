This example is an implementation of CRAFT.

It simulates the design with key "18F4EEBDFCED7841D9E0E38CFE6A9405" and 10000 random plaintexts.

It injects exactly 2 stuck-at-0 faults for each run at clock cycle 5 on all Sbox instances: module "SubCellInst".

The generated Result.txt file shows for which plaintexts the result of the fault injection was ineffective or not.
